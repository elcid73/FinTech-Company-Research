The founders were Dave Girouard, former President of Enterprise Google, Paul Gu, a Thiel Fellow, and Anna Counselman, former Manager of Global Enterprise Customer Programs and Gmail Consumer Operations at Google.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea for the main Upstart product was based on combining predicting analytics and statistical models to assess the borrower's financial capacity and personal propensity to repay 3-year or 5-year loans and was based on wide variety of variables including schools attended, standardized test results, areas of study and work history.

Upstart raised a $1.75M seed round from First Round Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, New Enterprise Associates, Google Ventures, Crunchfund and Mark Cuban. They subsequently raised a series A round of $5.9M which included new investors Eric Schmidt (Google Executive Chairman), Marc Benioff, Khosla Ventures, Correlation Ventures, Founders Fund, and Collaborative Fund.[2] Upstart raised a Series C round of $35M from Third Point Capital in June 2015,[5] and $32.5M from Rakuten in 2017.[6] Upstart raised a Series D round of $50M from The Progressive Corporation in 2019.
In late 2020, Upstart went public via an IPO.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Upstart is trying to improve consumer loans’ risk and credit worthiness assessment to help loan issuers minimize or avoid defaults.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Customers are banks, credit unions, traditional finance companies and fintech lenders. Unsecured personal loan balances reached a record high of $222 billion in Q4 2022, which could serve as a proxy for overall market size.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Unlike traditional banks and credit unions, Upstart has developed a platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyze over 1,000 different variables about potential borrowers to come to lending decisions

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

Upstart Holdings are one of the first companies to use AI solutions in evaluating credit worthiness.


## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Personal lending

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?

Personal lending has increased, and so has the number of FinTech companies that use AI and statistical models to assess risk and credit worthiness. There has also been a steady increase of new entrants into the lending industry due to the proliferation of fintech.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The main competitors of Upstart include ACI Worldwide (ACIW), Plexus (PLXS), Smead Value Fund (SVFCX), Progress Software (PRGS), Perficient (PRFT), JFrog (FROG), Marqeta (MQ), Sprout Social (SPT), Impinj (PI), and Vicor (VICR).

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

After the initial increase of Upstart stock price following its IPO in 2019, the stock has declined by almost 95%.  Upstart's sales and profitability have been on the decline, despite management claims that its platform is more accurate than traditional credit evaluation systems.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Key KPIs for personal lenders:
1. Conversion Funnel - understanding when the company is losing a potential customer
2. Application Pull through Rate/ Loan Conversion Rate - percentage of loans applied for by applicants that are closed and funded by the lending institution
3. Cross-Sell & Upsell Support - checks if personalized communication was targeted at the right consumer or not
4. Product Usage - checks if customers use the products regularly after they have bought them
5. Time to Decision - time is taken from the day the customer visits the website to the time the consumer lending process is completed
6. Automatic Approval Rate - measures the number of loan applications that prospective customers submit over a period and runs through an automated platform for conditional approval or denial divided by the total number of applications received in the same period in percentage
7. Average Response Time/Average Resolution Time - time taken to respond to a customer query/ complaint and the time taken to resolve it
8. Net Promoter Score (NPS) - measures the loyalty of customers towards the lending company
9. Customer lifetime value (CLV) - measures the total value of the customer

Upstart has been underperforming across many of these KPIs as evidenced by declining sales and profits. Specifically, it seems like NPS and CLV are not were they should be for Upstart to be successful

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Given the fact that the size of the personal loan market has been steadily increasing, while Upstart sales and profit declined, shows that it’s been underperforming compared to its competitors.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Start developing credit evaluation models for mortgages and corporate loans as well as creating models for venture capital investing.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

It will help Upstart expand its offering portfolio and generate additional revenue streams from other lucrative sources while it is struggling in personal loan space.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
They should continue to use AI as a main technology, while adjusting the variables used to the most applicable in corporate lending and venture capital areas.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
AI and machine learning are very powerful tools and should serve Upstart well if it attempts to move into mortgages, corporate loans and venture capital.  It was one of the first to use AI for personal loans risk assessment and can do the same for other types of loans.
